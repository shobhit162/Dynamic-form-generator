# Dynamic-form-generator
It is an assignment of a company where I have to built a dynamic form generator which allows user to choose from text, textarea, checkbox, radio button and dropdown along with its validations.


To run the app on your local machine, run

```
git clone https://github.com/shobhit162/Dynamic-form-generator.git
cd Dynamic-form-generator
npm install
npm start
```
